# Car-price-prediction

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction repository! This project aims to predict car prices based on various features and attributes of the vehicles.

**About**

In this repository, you will find:

Datasets containing information about cars including features like make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Trained machine learning models for car price prediction.
Documentation and resources related to the project.


**Data
**
The datasets provided include a variety of attributes about cars such as:

Make and model
Year of manufacture
Mileage
Fuel type
Transmission type
Engine capacity
Number of previous owners
Car condition
Location

**Models**

We have trained several machine learning models including:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Support Vector Regression
These models are trained on the provided datasets and evaluated based on their performance metrics.

**Usage**

You can utilize this project for:

Predicting car prices based on input features.
Understanding the importance of different features in determining car prices.
Exploring various machine learning algorithms for regression tasks.

**How to Use**
